# React Gallery Project

## Description

*Duration: 4 day Sprint*

This React gallery web app allows you to add an image to a gallery.

There was only one issue I ran into while building this app. The issue was a 500 error on my client side. When I looked at my server logs, I noticed a "database "react_gallery" does not exist" error, even though it did exist. I resolved this by deleting the existing database and creating a new one with the same name.
